[ ] Don't allow synchronisation between syncd instances where time delta is >1000ms
[ ] Review protocol and make sure we're sending everything in the most basic units possible, don't rely on Qt's synchronisation of e.g. QString and other types
[ ] Don't load all objects on startup
[ ] Wait for clouds to be ready before starting to synchronise
[ ] Use some kind of notification mechanism to watch for new clouds
[ ] Investigate incremental sends vs batch sends (i.e. send object lists of 100 each to allow for some interleaving of requests)
[ ] Don't drop connections to existing sync daemons whenever a syncd instance appears/disappears (bonjour)
[ ] Move Bonjour code to libsaesu
[ ] User authentication
    [ ] SSL
    [ ] Fingerprint verification of certificate
    [ ] Share verified fingerprints across the network, store them
    [ ] GUI to make all this work, somehow, instead of autoconnects to all devices
